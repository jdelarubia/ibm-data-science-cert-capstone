## Conclusions

- Number of successful launches increases has increased over the last years, significantly from 2015. The success trend seems to stabilize at a 60 - 90% ratio from 2016 onwards.
- The number of launches has also increased, so the successes have gone up. VAFB show the best ratio of succeeded launches. KSC doesnâ€™t show information below almost 40 launches.
- Orbits such as ES-L1, GEO, HEO and SSO show a 100% success launch rate. On the contrary, GTO reaches only a ~50% success rate.
- Launch sites KSC LC-39A has a higher success launch rate (~77%) while CCAFS LC40 has the worst ratio with a ~73% of failures.
- Launch sites are located relatively far from cities, while they do locate close to the shore and facilities as railroads.
- Payloads between 2000 and 5000 kg have a higher success rate (~62%). On the other hand, the ranges 0 - 2000 kg (77%), 5000 - 7000 kg (78%) show the highest failure rates.
- Falcon 9 FT boosters have a ~67% success rate.
- In our train/test split data examples, Logistic Regression perform best on training data (~86%), while SVM and LR (83% on both cases) do on test data.
